# NodeJS Typescript Template v2

Bare template for nodejs + typescript

```
npm i
npm run dev
```

## What is already in here :rocket:

- file structure following with: router, controller, daos, startup config
- simple jest unit test if you're new to it
- ts config
- jest config
- http requests for quick testing
- [Prisma ORM](https://www.prisma.io/)

## What is missing :construction_worker:

Well, a lot :smiley:, but I'll try to keep this up to date and include a few missing things

- proper error handling
- proper logging
- basic security
- swagger
- middlewares

## Notes

This is an attempt to help a few folks trying to get a grasp on nodejs(and ts) as well as for my own use :new_moon_with_face:
